# Machine learning project

## Topic: Rock, Paper, Scissors picture recognition

Objective of our project is to test algorithms learnt during ML classes on this simple topic.


Hopefully we will host interactive demo showind comprahansion of used algorithms.

## What is where - repository structure
- `first_test`: initial testing, may be removed later
- `model_selection`: testing classification models

## How to run this project?

- install requirements
`pip install xd`
- download dataset:
`python3 download_data.py`
